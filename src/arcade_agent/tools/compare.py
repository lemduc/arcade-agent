    """Compare two architectures and report differences.

    Uses the Hungarian algorithm to find optimal component matching based
    on entity overlap, then reports additions, removals, and changes.

    Args:
        arch_a: Source architecture (e.g., version N).
        arch_b: Target architecture (e.g., version N+1).

    Returns:
        Dict with overall similarity, component matches, the provenance-derived
        ``structural`` classification (see ``structural_dict``), and summary
        stats. ``matches`` is the raw 1:1 Hungarian view and is kept as-is for
        similarity scoring; ``structural`` is the accurate split/merge-aware
        view and is what ``components_added``/``components_removed`` in
        ``summary`` are derived from. Consumers rendering component names as
        "added" or "removed" should read from ``structural``, not by
        inspecting ``matches`` for missing sides, to avoid reporting the same
        diff two different ways in one place.
